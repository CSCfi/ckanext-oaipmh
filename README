OAI-PMH Plugin for CKAN
=======================
This plugin provides two things: a harvester which can be configured to harvest
datasets from a OAI-PMH data source and a fully compatible interface for OAI-PMH
which can list all datasets and resources in CKAN for OAI-PMH.

Harvester
=========

The steps to install harvester, add the extension name 'oaipmh_harvester'
to the configuration option 'ckan.plugins' of the CKAN ini file in use.

After this restart CKAN. Then navigate to '/harvest', add a harvesting source.
For this source do:
  * Fill in URL to a OAI-PMH repository.
  * Select 'Source Type' to be 'OAI-PMH'.
  * In configuration, you must add your selected sets that should be imported.
  The format is JSON and only accepts a string named 'query'
    eg. '{"query":["Faculty of Science and Forestry"]}'
  * Click save

You may need to configure your fetch and gather consumer to be run as daemons or
via a the paster commands.

This is clearly documented in ckanext-harvest extension, see it here:

configuration option 'ckan.plugins' of the CKAN ini file in use.
